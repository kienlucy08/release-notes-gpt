    "- Strategic Theme (choose one or multiple: Improve UX/UI, System Hardening, Platform Expansion, Market Expansion, Business Development, Field Enablement)\n"
    "- Area of Impact (QC Editor Page, Data Editing, Structure Survey, Compound Survey, Plumb and Twist Survey, Guy Facilities Survey, Dashboard, User login, Account Page, File Uploader, Section within a selected survey, Sites page, Site visits page, Survey Processing, etc) You can pick and choose which areas seem to have the biggest area of impact.\n"

    "Flag Messages Assigned to the Wrong Surveys"
    "System Hardening | Survey Processing, Site Visit Flags, Accordion Header Messaging \n"
    "Description: Resolved a defect where flag messages entered in one survey were incorrectly displayed in the next downstream within the same Site Visit, causing miscommunication across grouped surveys. \n"
    "Details:\n" 
    "- Previously, when users added a flag message to a survey (e.g., Compound), the message appeared in the next survey in the processing sequence (e.g., Structure).\n"
    "- This issue affected all sequential survey types (Compound → Structure → Guy Facilities → P & T), causing a circular shift in flag display order. \n"
    "- This bug stemmed from incorrect data linkage in the flag display logic, which pulled flag data from the wrong survey GUID. \n"
    "Impact to Users:\n"
    "- Flag messages now stay scoped to the survey they were created in , ensuring that QA notes and field flags are only visible in their intended context.\n"
    "- Prevents cross-survey contamination of flags, reducing the risk of confusion during review, reporting, or reprocessing. \n"
    "Here is an example feature release note: \n"
    "Improve UX | Dashboard Tables\n"
    "Description: Introduced a new column for Site ID (SiteIdentifier) in the Site Visits dashboard tab, improving visibility and searchability for key location identifiers.\n"
    "Details:\n"
    "- Added SiteIdentifier as a dedicated column in the Site Visits table.\n"
    "- Enabled full support for filtering and sorting on this column.\n"
    "- Ensures alignment with other tables where Site ID is a core reference field.\n"
    "Impact to Users:\n"
    "- Users can now quickly locate and differentiate Site Visits based on Site ID.\n"
    "- Improves dashboard consistency and reduces the need to cross-reference external datasets for identifiers.\n"
    "- Streamlines workflows for users managing multiple site-level records.\n"
