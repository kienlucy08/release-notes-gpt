![tag](Improve UX/UI) | Dashboard Tables  

A bug where the dashboard table pagination displays NaN in some cases for the current page when switching between tabs has been resolved.

*Details:*  
• Resolved NaN display issue on dashboard table pagination.  
• Fixed table data fetching before component initialization.  
• Addressed side effects like loading animation sticking, URL filter issues, incorrect page numbers, and styling bugs.  
• Improved filter input fields to prevent lagging of the web application.  
• Filters now work on all datatable columns by default.  

*Impact to Users:*  
• Users will no longer see NaN displayed on the dashboard table pagination.  
• Tables will now load correctly without issues like loading animation sticking or incorrect page numbers.  
• Filter input fields will no longer cause lag in the application when typing.  
• Improved filtering functionality for better user experience.
