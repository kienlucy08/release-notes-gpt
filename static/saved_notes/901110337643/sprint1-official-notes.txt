**Survey123 Conditionality Gap Closure**  
*Improvement UX/UI System Hardening* | QC Editor, Survey Data Storage  
Developers will sync the display logic in QC Editor for Compound Survey, Guy Facilities Survey, and Structure Climb Survey with Survey123 forms. This will prevent null values causing issues and ensure data accuracy. New fields will be added as needed, with potential database columns for data storage.  
*Details:*  
- Ensure QC Editor matches Survey123's conditional display logic accurately.
- Implement safeguards against null data causing errors or corruption.
- Add required fields and logic for data parity between application and surveys.
- Update database schema to include additional fields for storing new data.
*Impact to Users:*  
- Consistent behavior between QC Editor and Survey123 forms.
- Reduced risk of errors or data corruption.
- Improved data integrity and completeness.

**Implement ClickUp-compatible Bug Reporting System**  
*Improve UX/UI* | Web Application, Bug Reporting  
A ClickUp form has been embedded in the web app for users to report issues, bugs, and missing content easily. Users can access the Give Feedback page to provide feedback through the form.  
*Details:*  
- Create a Give Feedback menu item in the web application.
- Embed the ClickUp form in the Give Feedback page on app.fieldsync.io and test.fieldsync.io.
*Impact to Users:*  
- Users can easily report issues and provide feedback through the embedded ClickUp form.
- Centralized location for user feedback to streamline issue resolution.
- Improved communication between users and the engineering team.

*Note: The ClickUp-compatible bug reporting system implementation is focused on the backend for web application improvement and may not be directly visible to end users.*

*Impact to Users:*  
• Users face limitations importing survey payloads, affecting data management efficiency.  
• Error message leads to confusion and hinders the import process.

**Feature: "Allow Null Value" Checkboxes**  
Improve UX/UI | Data Processing  
Introducing checkboxes to address null value issues in specific survey fields, providing a manual bypass for fields that logically remain empty.
*Details:*  
• Checkbox "Elevation not applicable" added to Structure survey > Deficiency records.  
• Checkbox "Clear distance not applicable" added to Structure survey > Base and Foundation records.  
• Checkbox "Generator output inaccessible by field technician" added to Compound survey > Generator records.
