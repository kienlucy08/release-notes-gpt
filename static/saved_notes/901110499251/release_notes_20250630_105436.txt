- Bug: Legs count on site visit page always shows 4
Strategic Theme: Improve UX/UI
Area of Impact: Site Visit Page
Description: The displayed number of legs for lattice towers on the Site Visit page is always shown as 4, regardless of the actual number stored in the payload. This discrepancy can lead to inaccurate information being conveyed to users.
Details:
- The Site Visit page incorrectly displays all lattice towers as having 4 legs, even when the structure_legs_count value in the payload indicates a different number.
- Users can confirm the discrepancy by checking the P&T payload's structure_legs_count value, which may show 3, for example.
- The desired outcome is to accurately reflect the number of legs the structure has on the Site Visit screen.
Impact to Users:
- Users will now see the correct number of legs displayed for lattice towers on the Site Visit page.
